# Human-Factor-Engineering
Human factor engineering plays a crucial role in health informatics by focusing on designing and optimizing healthcare systems, technologies, and interfaces to enhance usability, efficiency, and safety for healthcare professionals and patients alike. By applying principles of human factors, such as understanding cognitive processes, physical ergonomics, and user-centered design, health informatics aims to create intuitive and accessible systems that support accurate clinical decision-making, streamline workflow processes, and minimize errors. This discipline ensures that electronic health records (EHRs), medical devices, telemedicine platforms, and healthcare software are tailored to meet the needs of diverse users, ultimately improving the quality of care delivery and patient outcomes in healthcare settings.

The analysis focused on accelerometer data from patient 2966 revealed several key findings:

Identification of Activity Patterns: The data analysis successfully identified patterns of sedentary behavior and active movement based on acceleration magnitude. This allowed for a clear distinction between periods of inactivity and physical activity.

Quantification of Sedentary Behavior: By applying thresholds and data segmentation techniques, sedentary periods were accurately isolated and quantified. This provided valuable insights into the patient's daily activity levels and behavior patterns.

Insights into Patient Activity: The M3 metric, derived from the analysis, provided a quantitative measure of overall activity level and hourly variations. This metric proved useful in monitoring Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and assessing changes in activity patterns over time.

Visualization and Interpretation: Graphical representations, including line charts and bar plots, effectively visualized the data, aiding in the interpretation of trends and patterns in arm movements throughout the day.

Overall, the analysis facilitated a comprehensive understanding of the patient's physical activity and sedentary behavior, demonstrating the utility of accelerometer data and data mining techniques in healthcare monitoring and patient care.
